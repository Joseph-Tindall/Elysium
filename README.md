    <h1>Elysium</h1>
</div>

A C# .NET-based project revolving around silent software deployment and management for Windows machines. The repository is offered as [source-available](https://github.com/Joseph-Tindall/Elysium?tab=License-1-ov-file), allowing you to modify the source as needed, provided no financial profit or commercial gain is accomplished using the project.

## Vision

The project's main goal is to increase the quality of life for administrators by providing a free solution to maintain software versioning and system updates across the domain. This product is aimed at low-operating cost facilities, much like as the research laboratories I started my career off in.

## Support

This project is offered on an AS-IS basis, I do not guarantee support for any issues that may arise.

    <h1>Elysium</h1>
</div>

A C# .NET-based project revolving around silent software deployment and management for Windows machines.

The project's main goal is to increase the quality of life for engineers  by providing a free solution to maintain software versioning and system updates across the domain. 

Altogether, the project hopes to deliver a product that can achieve the following:

* Host Elysium as a dedicated server VM, allowing for one point of maintenance.
* Deploy files such as `.exe` and `.msi` to remote machines.
* Feature a coding block style of conditions to allow flexible application/programming packages.
* Enable direct script support such as `PowerShell` or `Command` that can be run as target systems or a specific user account.
* Maintain an extensive logging set to obtain failure reports for executables and scripts to assist with troubleshooting.

## Support
